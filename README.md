# xtransduce

Arduino sketch to link X-Plane to a transducer. It's used to "feel" the rotor vibrations
based on its RPMs and gives feedback on G-forces and warns at VRS situations.
The volume is controlled by 5 digital outputs which are connected to a R2R resistor array
which is used as voltage dividers. So we have 31 different volumes/levels for the pulses, 
plus the option to mute it completely. 

The resistors have to be selected depending of the desired output levels. In my setup I was
using 56k for for R1 - R5 , 10k for R6 and 28k ( 2x56k parallel ) for R7 - R10.

The output line (3.5mm jack) is supposed to feed a subwoofer amp which drives the transducer
