# xtransduce

Arduino sketch to link X-Plane to a transducer. It's used to "feel" the rotor vibrations
based on its RPMs and gives feedback on G-forces and warns at VRS situations.
The volume is controlled by 5 digital outputs which are connected to diodes and resistors
which are used as voltage dividers. So we have 5 different volumes/levels for the pulses plus the
option to mute it completely.

# the output line is supposed to feed a subwoofer amp which drives the transducer
